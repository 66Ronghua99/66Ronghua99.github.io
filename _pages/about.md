Hi visitor! I am Ronghua Li (call me Cory if you like, easier pronouncing), currently pursuing my PhD at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.astaple.com/), advised by <a href="https://haibohu.org/">Prof. Haibo Hu</a>. Before that, I got my master degree from KTH, Sweden, advised by [Panos Papadimitratos](https://people.kth.se/~papadim/). My main research focuses on studying security and privacy issues in modern IoT systems with ML/DL techniques. I'm very open to AI/network/security collaborations; feel free to reach out to me via email or Wechat (lrh893304167)!
